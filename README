This is a semantics of Nvidia's CUDA-C implemented using the K framework term
rewriting system.

It's a fork of Chucky Ellison's C semantics with changes and additions to
support various features of Nvidia's "nvcc" compiler. In addition to the
special kernel launch syntax ("<<< >>>") and various attributes ("__device__",
"__shared__", etc.), many functions from the CUDA Runtime API are at least
partially supported. See semantics/includes/cuda.h for some clues about the
current state of things.

Installation and build instructions can be found in the README from Chucky's C
semantics ("README-C"), although we've renamed the generated interpretter to
"cudak" (from "kcc") and made some other minor changes to the build system to
avoid conflict or confusion with the vanilla-C semantics. As mentioned in
README-C, make sure to download the K Framework version 2.7 and not the latest
version.

Race checking and other properties of the semantics can be configured in
semantics/cuda-properties.k.
