This is a semantics of Nvidia's CUDA-C implemented using the K framework term
rewriting system.

It's a fork of Chucky Ellison's C semantics with changes and additions to
support various features of Nvidia's "nvcc" compiler. In addition to the
special kernel launch syntax ("<<< >>>") and various annotations ("__device__",
"__shared__", etc.), many functions from the CUDA Runtime API are at least
partially supported. See semantics/includes/cuda.h for some clues about the
current state of things.

Installation and build instructions can be found in the README from Chucky's
C semantics ("README-C").
